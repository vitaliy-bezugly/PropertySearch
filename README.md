## Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/vitaliy-bezugly/PropertySearch.git
```

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Local running</h2>
To run the application on your local machine, you have two options:

<ol>
<li>
  Using .NET Core: Make sure you have the .NET Core SDK installed. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root folder of the project. Run the following command:
</li>

```
dotnet run --project src/PropertySearch.Api
```

Ensure that you have configured environment variables.

<li>
  Using <code>Docker</code>: Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine.
</li>

Firstly, you need to create an .env file in the root folder where you will describe the configuration of the projects. You must add the following keys:
- <code>MSSQL_PASSWORD</code> - password for the mssql database
- <code>MSSQL_PORT</code> - mssql database port (optionally it should be 1433)
- <code>PS_DOCKER_PORT</code> - port of the "Property Search" application in the docker (optionally 80). If you want to install a different one, make sure you add the exact same port as the property lookup service environment variable in <code>docker-compose.yml</code>
- <code>PS_HOST_PORT</code> - port of the real estate search application on the host computer
- <code>PS_SEND_GRID_KEY</code> - your platform private key <a src="https://sendgrid.com/">Send Grid</a> to send email
- <code>PS_IP_INFO_TOKEN</code> - your personal token <a src="https://ipinfo.io/">IP Info</a>

Then, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root folder of the project. Run the following command:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will build and run the Docker containers for the application, along with all their dependencies. The API will be accessible at http://localhost:8080 on your host computer.

Note: With Docker, the necessary database migrations will be applied automatically.

## Environment variables 

<ul>
  <li>DB_CONN - connection string of <code>MSSQL</code> database</li>
  <li>SendGridKey - your platform private key <a src="https://sendgrid.com/">Send Grid</a> to send email</li>
  <li>IpInfoToken - your personal token <a src="https://ipinfo.io/">IP Info</a></li>
</ul>
